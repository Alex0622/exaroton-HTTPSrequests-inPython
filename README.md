# Information about this repository.
This repository contains the files which give you an example of how to do a HTTPS request using the exaroton API in Python. You can check the exaroton API documentation [here](https://support.exaroton.com/hc/en-us/articles/360011926177-API-documentation).

After adding your API token and (in case that it's needed) your server ID, you can simply execute the Python file.
